                    Prepare to be enveloped in the comforting aroma of my
                    grandmother's cabbage rolls. These Polish stuffed cabbage
                    rolls, a testament to generations of delicious cooking, are
                    a project best undertaken with gusto. The prep work may be a
                    bit of a marathon, but the reward? Pillowy cabbage leaves
                    cradling a savory meat filling, baked to tender perfection.
                    I always make a mountain of them in my electric roaster,
                    knowing that the leftovers freeze beautifullyâ€”and somehow,
                    the freezing process transforms the cabbage into something
                    truly sublime. My grandma, a culinary alchemist, would
                    tinker endlessly with the filling, combining beef, veal, and
                    pork in various permutations. This recipe, born from her
                    meticulous notes, is a guide, not a rigid set of rules.
                    Don't be afraid to play with the spices, too. Sometimes, a
                    simple marjoram is all you need; other times, a dash of
                    Italian seasoning adds a vibrant note. Let your taste buds
                    be your guide.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>
                        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook cabbage in
                        boiling water until leaves are falling off. Remove
                        leaves from water as they peel off and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix together cooked onions, ground beef, chicken with
                        rice soup, rice, eggs, marjoram, salt, and pepper in a
                        large bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Melt margarine in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook
                        onions in hot margarine until translucent, 5 to 7
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take a cabbage leaf, lay it flat, and trim the thickest
                        part toward the bottom of leaf to make it easier to
                        roll; repeat with all leaves. Take darker outside leaves
                        and line the bottom of a roasting pan with them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scoop a portion of beef meat mixture into a leaf and
                        wrap leaf around mixture, enveloping meat completely.
                        Repeat until all of the beef mixture is used. Arrange
                        stuffed cabbage leaves into the roasting pan. Top with
                        any remaining cabbage leaves. Cover the roasting pan
                        with aluminum foil.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 45 minutes.
                        Remove aluminum foil, peel back top layer of extra
                        cabbage leaves, and pour golden mushroom soup over
                        stuffed cabbage leaves. Replace top cabbage leaves,
                        return the roasting pan to the oven, and continue baking
                        until soup is hot, about 15 minutes.
