                    Passed down through generations, this dumplings recipe
                    whispers tales of my Polish grandfather and the old-world
                    kitchen where my grandmother learned its secrets. A few
                    modern twists have been added over the years, but the heart
                    of the tradition remains. Enjoy them simply, or dress them
                    up with butter, sour cream, bacon—the possibilities are
                    endless. Mastering the art of the dumplings takes practice,
                    but trust me, the delicious results are worth every bit of
                    effort. You'll soon find your own rhythm in the kitchen,
                    carrying on the legacy.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare the dough: Stir flour and salt together in a
                        large bowl. Whisk sour cream, eggs, egg yolk, butter,
                        and oil in a separate bowl. Stir wet ingredients into
                        flour until well blended and dough comes together. Cover
                        the bowl with a towel, and let stand for 15 to 20
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Place potatoes into a
                        pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a
                        boil, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain potatoes, and mash with shredded cheese and cheese
                        sauce while still hot. Season with onion salt, salt, and
                        pepper. Set aside to cool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Separate dumplings dough into two balls. Roll out one
                        ball at a time on a lightly floured surface until it is
                        thin enough to work with, but not too thin so that it
                        tears, between 1/8- and 1/4-inch thick. Cut into circles
                        using a cookie cutter, dumplings cutter, or a glass, 3-
                        to 4-inches in diameter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assemble the dumplings: Brush a little water around the
                        edges of the circles, and spoon some filling into the
                        center.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fold the circles over into half-circles, and press to
                        seal the edges with fingers, or use a fork for crimped
                        edges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place dumplings on a cookie sheet, and freeze. Once
                        frozen, transfer to freezer storage bags or containers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To cook the dumplings: Bring a large pot of lightly
                        salted water to a boil. Lower dumplings into the water
                        in batches. Cook until they float to the top, about 5
                        minutes. Do not boil too long, or they will be soggy.
                        Remove with a slotted spoon.
