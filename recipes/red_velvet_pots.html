                    These red velvet pots de creme offer a decadent yet
                    surprisingly light chocolate dessert perfect for special
                    occasions. Boasting a richer chocolate flavor than
                    traditional red velvet cake, complemented by a subtle cream
                    cheese tang, they're easy to make, visually stunning, and
                    utterly delicious.

                    <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
                    <li>
                        4 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate (62% cacao), broken
                        into small pieces
                    </li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon red gel food coloring, or as needed</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup cream cheese</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Whipped Topping (optional)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup very cold heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For pots de creme, whisk together milk, cream, and egg
                        yolks in a saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly with a
                        spatula over medium heat, until the mixture is hot and
                        steamy, but has not begun to simmer yet. An instant read
                        thermometer inserted into the mixture should read 160
                        degrees F (71 degrees C).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from heat, add chocolate, and swirl pan a few
                        times to settle chocolate down. Let sit for 2 minutes.
                        Add salt, vanilla, and red coloring.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After 2 minutes, add cream cheese, and whisk everything
                        until smooth. If cream cheese is not mixing in
                        completely, use a stick blender to mix for a few
                        seconds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer mixture into serving glasses or jars. Place
                        jars on a tray and tap each one gently a few times to
                        bring any air bubbles to the surface. Cover with plastic
                        wrap and chill in the refrigerator until cold and firm,
                        at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For whipped topping, add heavy cream, confectioner's
                        sugar, cream cheese, and vanilla to a bowl, and whisk
                        until medium-stiff peaks form. Add to a piping bag, and
                        pipe (or spoon) over chilled pots de creme. Dust lightly
                        with cocoa powder, and serve.
