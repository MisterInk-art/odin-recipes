# Project: Odin Recipes

This project is a recipe website built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. It serves as a practical exercise in web development, focusing on core concepts like HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript (depending on the project's scope).

## Project Goals

This project was undertaken primarily for educational purposes, allowing me to:

-   Gain hands-on experience with HTML structure and semantic markup.
-   Practice styling web pages using CSS.
-   (If applicable) Implement interactive elements and dynamic behavior with JavaScript.
-   Reinforce fundamental web development principles learned through The Odin Project curriculum.
